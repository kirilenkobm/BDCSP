# BDCSP - Binary, Decisional, Closest String Problem version

Considered to be a NP-complete problem.

Here I'm trying to find a fast solution.

Likely not polynomial.

And if yes, probably not absolutely precise.

## To write

* what is the problem, overview
* patterns concept
* complications on patterns concept
* why decisional and binary version
* estimated complexity
