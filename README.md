# BDCSP - Binary, Decisional, Closest String Problem version

Considered to be a NP-complete problem.

Here I'm trying to find a fast solution.

Likely not polynomial.

And if yes, probably not absolutely precise.

On linux/MacOS:

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:kirilenkobm/bdcsp.git
cd bdcsp/
make
```

On windows:

```bat
git clone git@gitlab.com:kirilenkobm/bdcsp.git
cd bdcsp\
.\Win_make.bat
```

## To write

* what is the problem, overview
* patterns concept
* complications on patterns concept
* why decisional and binary version
* estimated complexity
