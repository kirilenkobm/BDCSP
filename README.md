# BDCSP - Binary, Decisional, Closest String Problem version

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/kirilenkobm/bdcsp/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/kirilenkobm/bdcsp/commits/master)

## What is the problem

What is the problem: [1]. Is also np complete in case of binary alphabet:[2]. Coming soon.

Here, I suggest an polynomial approximation for this task with precision measurements.

<https://example.com>

Briefly, the suggested algorithm solves the problem in:

``` math
O(W^3 * H^2)
```

Where:

- W - string length
- H - number of strings

in the worst case.

## Usage

On linux/MacOS:

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:kirilenkobm/bdcsp.git
cd bdcsp/
make
```

On windows:

```bat
git clone git@gitlab.com:kirilenkobm/bdcsp.git
cd bdcsp\
.\Win_make.bat
```

To run tests/*.ipynb install requirements first:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate input files:

```shell
make rnd
./generate_input
```

Will compile random datasets generator in C

Program usage:

```txt
Usage: ./CSP [input file] [k] [-v] [-p]
[input file]: text file containing input or stdin
[k]: minimal distance to check, positive integer number
[-v] <number 0 .. 3>: enable verosity mode, set logging level from 1 to 3, 0 - nothing
[-h]: show this message
[-V]: show version
[-p]: show patterns
[-nr]/[--nr]: you promise there are no repetative strings (not recommended) =)
[-r]: render initial state (not recommended on big datasets)
[-f]: optimize first line
[-s]: sanity checks, just check the input correctness and quit
[-sr]/[--sr] <filaname>: save final render to file
[-a]: try to get distance to average line
```

For better (in average) results, add -f and -z options.

Also, results might be improved with:

```shell
../call_for_each_line.py [input_file] [k]
```

Warning - takes X str_num more operations!
