# BDCSP - Binary, Decisional, Closest String Problem version

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/kirilenkobm/bdcsp/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/kirilenkobm/bdcsp/commits/master)

## What is the problem

What is the problem: [1]. Is also np complete in case of binary alphabet:[2]. Coming soon.

Here, I suggest an efficient algorithm, that solves decisional version of the closest string problem over the binary alphabet in polynomial time. Likely, this is a good approximation. More details in the following article:

<https://example.com>

Briefly, the suggested algorithm solves the problem in:

``` math
O(N^4)
```

in the worst case.

## Usage

On linux/MacOS:

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:kirilenkobm/bdcsp.git
cd bdcsp/
make
```

On windows:

```bat
git clone git@gitlab.com:kirilenkobm/bdcsp.git
cd bdcsp\
.\Win_make.bat
```

To run generate_inputs.py and tests.ipynb install requirements first:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents

- src/ - C source code, the algorithm implementation itself:
  - CSP.c/h - enrty point
  - read_input.c/h - read and check input
  - patterns.c/h - patterns-related operations
- generate_input.py - python script to generate input files and answers
- tests/ - folder for test files generated by generate_input.py
  - input_files/ - folder for input datasets
  - answers/ - folder with answers for each dataset
- Makefile and Win_make.bat - build instructions for Linux/MacOS and Windows
- run_tests.sh - shell script to check that everything builds and returns correct results for sample data
- shuffle_input.py - script to shuffle input making line N first
- requirements.txt - libraries required for performance tests and input generation in python
- Minor stuff:
  - LICENSE
  - .gitignore
  - .gitlab-ci.yml
  - CHANGELOG
  - README.md =)
